# Track Your Employees

A client wanted an application to store, track, and add employees with their respective departments, roles, and salaries. This is an interface that allows the user to access the database that stores their employee information.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to interact with the user via the command line, and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.
